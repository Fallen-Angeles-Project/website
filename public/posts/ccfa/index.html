<p><strong>Layering Reason</strong> - is a monument by artist Zadik Zadikian as a dedication from the Armenian community to the fallen soldiers of the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh that took the lives of thousands of Armenian soldiers.</p>
<p>For Armenians around the globe, this is a tragic topic. The goal of this monument is to immortalize the fallen soldiers and give the viewer a visceral experience of the scale of loss inflicted by the conflict. Along with this, the piece aims to be a work of hope.</p>
<p>The artist conceptualized the work as a site-specific piece for the Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Yerevan. The architecture of the museum heavily influenced the design of the piece.</p>
<p>All original artwork will be fabricated in Los Angeles, California, and donated by the sponsors to the Cafesjian Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>This project is being made possible by the generous support from the following key sponsors.</p>
