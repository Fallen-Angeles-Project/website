## Fallen Angels Monument - Coming in Fall 2024

**Layering Reason** - is a monument by artist Zadik Zadikian as a dedication from the Armenian community to the fallen soldiers of the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh that took the lives of thousands of Armenian soldiers.

For Armenians around the globe, this is a tragic topic. The goal of this monument is to immortalize the fallen soldiers and give the viewer a visceral experience of the scale of loss inflicted by the conflict. Along with this, the piece aims to be a work of hope.

The artist conceptualized the work as a site-specific piece for the Cafesjian Center for the Arts in Yerevan. The architecture of the museum heavily influenced the design of the piece.

All original artwork will be fabricated in Los Angeles, California, and donated by the sponsors to the Cafesjian Center for the Arts.

This project is being made possible by the generous support from the following key sponsors.
