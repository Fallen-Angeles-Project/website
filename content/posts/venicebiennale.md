## Armenian Pavilion - Venice Biennale - 2026

**Venice Biennale Arte - 2026** - Fallen Angels Inc. is honored to announce that the Republic of Armenia will be represented at the 2026 Venice Biennale by artist Zadik Zadikian, whose visionary practice spans decades of sculptural innovation and a lifelong dialogue with material, light, and the metaphysics of artistic making. In alignment with the Biennale’s curatorial theme In Minor Keys—an invitation to create spaces of reflection, resonance, and poetic attunement—Zadikian will transform the Armenian Pavilion into a living, breathing studio: a site of continual making, presence, and shared experience.

This project marks a significant milestone for both the artist and the Armenian cultural community. Rather than presenting a static exhibition, Zadikian will inhabit the pavilion as an active workspace, allowing visitors to witness the unfolding of form and thought in real time. The pavilion becomes an island of creative practice—an environment where material experimentation, contemplative process, and the rhythms of daily artistic labor become part of the exhibition itself. This approach reflects the Biennale’s call to listen more deeply, to embrace the quieter frequencies of artistic life, and to encounter art not as spectacle but as a continuous, evolving score.

Fallen Angels Inc. is proud to support this ambitious and meaningful undertaking. As a nonprofit dedicated to uplifting artists whose work expands cultural dialogue, we are committed to helping ensure that Armenia’s presence at the 2026 Biennale is both impactful and profoundly resonant. We look forward to sharing more updates as the project develops and to welcoming global audiences into a space where imagination, process, and identity are honored in their most essential forms.
