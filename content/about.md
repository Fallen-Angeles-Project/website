**Fallen Angels** is a nonprofit organization committed to elevating Armenian culture on the global stage through the power of art. Our mission is to deepen awareness, understanding, and appreciation of Armenia’s rich cultural heritage—both across the worldwide Armenian diaspora and within the broader international arts community. Through exhibitions, artistic collaborations, and cultural initiatives, we champion creative expression as a bridge between communities and a catalyst for shared democratic values.

We support artists, institutions, and educational programs that foster dialogue and cross-cultural exchange, ensuring that Armenian voices remain vibrant, visible, and influential within today’s cultural landscape. In this spirit, Fallen Angels is honored to lead and support major international projects such as the Armenian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale 2026, advancing Armenia’s artistic innovation at one of the most significant and respected cultural platforms in the world.
